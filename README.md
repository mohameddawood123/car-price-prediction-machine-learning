Project idea : -
It’s a machine learning model that predict used car price.
The steps that we do it to build the model: -
1. Importing modules and data. 
2. Data Exploration.
3. Data Cleaning.
4. Feature engineering.
5. Data Visualisation.
6. Encoding categorical Data.
7. Feature selection.
8. Data scaling
9. Training Models and Evaluating results.
10. Used Models in this Project (linear regression -
polynomial regression – random forest regression)
11. using PCA in Polynomial regression
